# Hackerrank Challenge - Day 7: Arrays

## Objective
Today, we're learning about the Array data structure. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task
Given an array, **_A_**, of **_N_** integers, print **_A_**'s elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, **_N_** (the size of our array).
The second line contains **_N_** space-separated integers describing array **_A_**'s elements.

## Constraints
* **_1 <= N <= 1000_**
* **_1 <= Ai <= 10000_**, where **_Ai_** is the **_i th_** integer in the array.

## Output Format

Print the elements of array **_A_** in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

### Sample Input
```
